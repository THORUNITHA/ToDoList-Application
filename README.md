# ToDoList-Application
Nobody is capable of remembering everything at all times. To-do lists are a useful external memory aid that give you permission to forget. As long as you can remember to look at your to-do list, you will never lose anything that you have recorded on it.

Node.js is a server that makes able to run JavaScript code "Server Side". It is based on V8, the JavaScript engine used in Chrome, and uses some modules to help working with the filesystem, sockets, HTTP, etc.

To-Do List project is an application specially built to keep track of errands or tasks that need to be done. This application will be like a task keeper where the user would be able to enter the tasks that they need to do. Once they are done with their tasks they can also remove them from the list.

We can create separate list like Work list , College list , Today list. The task is maintained independently for each list so that user can keep track of them.

1) You can add the tasks that are to be done in a descriptive way.
2) You will be able to add as many tasks as you have.
3) Once the task is completed, you will be able to remove it by clicking on "checkbox" button.
